\section{Learning to Rank Algorithm}

The algorithm used for choosing from the list of links is called Learning to Rank. This machine learning algorithm ranks a set of 'documents' given a query based on a set of features defined previously and provides a label (grade) to these documents. The label, or relevance of a document, can be given in multiple forms:

\begin{itemize}  
\item Binary Label 
\item Multi-Level Judgement 
\item Pairwise Preferences 
\end{itemize}
