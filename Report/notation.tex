\subsection{Notation}

We denote our set of prominent articles\fxnote{A doenst show in pdf} $A = \{ \alpha_1, ..., \alpha_M \}$ where $\alpha_i$ is one of $M$ prominent articles. Belonging to the $i^{\text{th}}$ prominent article is a set $B_i$ of linked articles: $B_i = \{ \beta_1, ..., \beta_{N_i} \}$ where $N_i$ is the number of referenced articles for the $i^{\text{th}}$ prominant article. \\

Click counts (popularity) for an article pair $(\alpha, \beta)$ is denoted $pop(\alpha, \beta)$. Eq. \ref{eq:pop_prom} defines the overall popularity of an arbitrary prominent article $\alpha_k$.

\begin{align}
pop(\alpha_k) = \sum\limits_{j=1}^{|B_k|} pop(\alpha_k, \beta_j)
\label{eq:pop_prom}
\end{align}

Eq. \ref{eq:pop_prom_link} defines the overall popularity of a prominent-linked article.

\begin{align}
pop(\beta) = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{|A|} pop(\alpha_i, \beta)
\label{eq:pop_prom_link}
\end{align}

In our set of ground truth we have that:

\begin{align}
rank(\alpha, \beta) = pop(\alpha, \beta)
\label{eq:pop_rank_relation_for_gt}
\end{align}
where a higher rank equals the level of popularity and a high rank therefore represents an important article pair.\\

This notation will be used throughout the rest of this article.
